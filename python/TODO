* hivetool: Methods for removing parameters and folders. 

* Methods for asking which file a certain parameter resides in. 

* GUI-editor, like Windows regedit och GConf gconf-editor. 

* Filesystem backend should work with directory hiearchy, not just one
  single parameter file. 

* When using filesystem backend, the parameter name should default to
  the file name, not "default". 

* Preserve indentation for changed parameters. 

* Add mechanism for overriding parameter values on command line. This
  could, for example, be done by setting an environment
  variable. Example:

  HIVEPARAMS="/global/background=black" mozilla

  Since environment variables are preserved across most exec() calls,
  Hiveconf should reset the HIVEPARAMS variable, as soons as it is
  read. This is because the parameter path is application relative;
  not machine relative. 

  We need to think about the case with mandatory settings as well; it
  shouldn't be possible to override mandatory settings with this
  command line mechanism. Two idéas:

  1) Mark parameters read from the environmant with a special tag, and
     introduce the new %noenviron directive, which resets alla these
     parameters. 

  2) Require that the environment is "mounted", just like other
     backends. In this case, the environment could be mounted after
     the mandatory hive. 

* Unit testing. 

* More examples. 

* More backends.
