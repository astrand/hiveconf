The file consists of sections and parameters. A section begins with
the name of the section in square brackets and continues until the
next section begins. Sections defines "Folders" in the HiveConfig
namespace. Sections contain parameters of the form

name = value

The file is line-based - that is, each newline-terminated line
represents either a comment, a section name or a parameter.

Section and parameter names are not case sensitive.

Only the first equals sign in a parameter is significant.  Whitespace
before or after the first equals sign is discarded. Leading, trailing
and internal whitespace in section and parameter names is
irrelevant. Leading and trailing whitespace in a parameter value is
discarded. Internal whitespace within a parameter value is retained
verbatim.

Any line beginning with a semicolon (';') or a hash ('#') character is
ignored, as are lines containing only whitespace.

Any line ending in a '\' is continued on the next line in the
customary UNIX fashion.

**FIXME: "Here-documents" are allowed. Describe them as well.
