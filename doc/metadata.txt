Meta-data support in Hiveconf
=============================

The support for meta-data in Hiveconf is not implemented yet. The
design is mostly finished, though. The idea is that a "attribute
namespace" should be defined, using the same mechanism as for the
normal "configuration namespace". The only difference is that
all parameters in the attribute namespace begins with %. There is a
correspondence between the attribute namespace and the configuration
namespace: Every parameter in the configuration namespace corresponds
to a folder in the attribute namespace. An example might help:

The parameter /global/workgroup is defined in
/etc/samba/smb.hconf. This parameter corresponds to the folder
%/global/workgroup in the attribute namespace. This folder can contain
parameters ("attributes") describing the parameter /global/workgroup,
like information about legal values. 

Attributes can be defined in the same hive files as where normal
parameters are defined, or in separate files. Here is an example:

/etc/samba/smb.hconf:

    [/global]
    workgroup = MYWORKGROUP
    
    [%/global/workgroup]
    datatype=string
    

The attribute names should be standardized, so that tools can know
their semantics. No attribute names are currently defined.
