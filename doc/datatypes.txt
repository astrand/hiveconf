Supported data types in Hiveconf
================================

Primitive data types
--------------------

* Strings

* Boolean

* Integers

* Floats

* Binary data


Compound data types
-------------------

* Lists of the above primitive data types. All values in a list must
  have the same primitive type.


String representation of data types. Details. 
---------------------------------------------
Each data type has a string representation, which is used in hive
configuration files. The details are described below. 

* Strings

  FIXME. 

* Boolean

  The preferred boolean string representation is true/false, but
  yes/no and 1/0 are also accepted. Case is not significant. 

  Note that when a hive configuration is re-written, yes/no and 1/0
  will be changed to true/false. 


* Integers

  Integers are limited to 32 bits, and can be positive or
  negative. The largest positive integer is 2147483647, and the
  smallest negative integer is -2147483648. 


* Floats

  The allowed range of floating point values is
  implementation-dependent. Some examples of floating point values:

  3.14    10.    .001    1e100    3.14e-10    0e0


* Binary data

  The maximum recommended size of binary data for each parameter is
  4096 bytes. Binary data are "hex encoded" in hive configuration
  files, that is, each octet is described with its hexadecimal ASCII
  value. Example: "Hive" is encoded as 48697665


* Lists

  List items are separated by whitespace. Example:

  10.0.0.1 10.0.0.2  192.168.10.1
