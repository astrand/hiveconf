Using Hiveconf in shell scripts
===============================

It's fairly easy to get and set parameters in Hiveconf from shell
scripts, via the tool "hivetool". 

Please not that the information in this file is only relevant to
SH-like shells, like Bash and zsh. csh-like shells are not covered.


Getting values
--------------
If you want to get a single parameter value, you can do:

WORKGROUP=`hivetool /services/samba/global/workgroup`

However, if you want to get many parameters, the delay introduced by
hivetool can be a problem. In this case, you can use the -e
parameter. Example:

    eval `hivetool \
        -e WORKGROUP=/services/samba/global/workgroup \
        -e SECURITY=/services/samba/global/security`

The variables WORKGROUP and SECURITY will now contain the workgroup
and security parameter values.


Setting values
--------------
There is no magic in setting variables from shell scripts. Here is an
example:

    WORKGROUP=MYNEWGROUP
    hivetool /services/samba/global/workgroup=$MYWORKGROUP

If the parameter path and/or value contains spaces, remember to
quote. Example:

    hivetool "/services/samba/global/server string=Fast server"
