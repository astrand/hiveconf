Hiveconf and Samba
==================

The Samba package (http://www.samba.org) is used throughout Hiveconf
as an example application. The reasons for this is:

1) It is a wide-spread and stable package

2) It includes both system services running as root (smbd and nmbd),
   and user tools like smbclient, nmblookup etc.

3) The configuration file smb.conf is compatible with the Hive file
   syntax. 


Even though Samba does not use the Hiveconf library (we need to write
a implementation in C first), "hivetool" can be useful as a
configuration tool. Here are some examples:

* List the current workgroup:

  hivetool /services/samba/workgroup


* Set workgroup:

  hivetool /services/samba/workgroup=SALES


* List all Samba parameters:

  hivetool -Ra /services/samba
