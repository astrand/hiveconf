Using mandatory and default settings with Hiveconf
==================================================

All applications using Hiveconf can use mandatory parameters
(parameters that only the system administrator can change) and default
parameters. This is configured by modifying the entry hive. 

Assume for a moment that Samba uses Hiveconf. If so, the entry hive
(/etc/samba/smb.hconf) could look like:

    # Mandatory settings
    %mount /etc/samba/smb.conf.mandatory
    
    # User settings
    %mount ~/.smb.conf
    
    # System defaults
    %mount /etc/samba/smb.conf
    
(You might ask what's the point of having user settings with a system
service like Samba. But Samba actually consists both of system
services and user tools, like smbclient. With the current
implementation, it's impossible for the user to configure the WINS
server, for example. This problem could be solved with Hiveconf.)

Look at python/examples/clarence/clarence/clarence.hconf for yet
another example.
