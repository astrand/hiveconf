Hiveconf is a system for storing configuration data (key-value
pairs). The purpose is similiar to the Windows registry or
GConf. Configuration data can be retrieved and modifyed via a simple
API. The data is stored using different "backends". The default
backend is using a text file format, similiar to smb.conf or Windows
.INI files.

Read the documentation in the "doc" directory for more
